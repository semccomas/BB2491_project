# BB2491_project
Project diary for Sarah McComas in the course BB2491.


[This script](https://github.com/semccomas/BB2491_project/blob/master/inference_parsimony.py) is the main script that we will run inference on, combining the old scripts of two peptide rule and the provided parsimony script. The other scripts in this directory are just old or helping me break down the script bit by bit. The wiki diary can be found [here](https://github.com/semccomas/BB2491_project/wiki).
